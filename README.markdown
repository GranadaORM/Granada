Granada
=====

This is a Release Candidate version now :) it seems to be working well.
Not fully unit tested yet, handle with care.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Surt/Granada.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Surt/Granada)

Granada now becomes a extended version of Idiorm/Paris, adding eager and lazy loading and lot of minor additions and changes.

Updated to Idiorm/Paris v1.4.0

Added eager loading
--------------------
You can use the "with" method to add relationships eager loading to the query.

```php
  $results = $user->with('avatar', 'posts')->find_many();
```
will use 3 querys to fetch the users and the relationships:
```sql
  SELECT * FROM user
  SELECT * FROM avatar WHERE user_id IN (....)
  SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id IN (....)
```
It is possible to get the relationships results for each result, this way

```php
  foreach($results as $result){
      echo $result->avatar->img;
      foreach($result->posts as $post){
         echo $post->title;
      }
  }
```


Chained relationships with arguments for eager loading!
--------------------------------------------------------
It is possible to chain relationships and add arguments to the relationships calls

```php
   // chained relationships use the "with" reserved word.
   $results = $user->with(array('posts'=>array('with'=>array('comments'))))->find_many();
   foreach($results as $result){
      foreach($posts as $post){
         echo $post->title;
         foreach($post->comments as $comment){
            echo $comment->subject;
         }
      }
   }


   // using arguments (not just one) to call the relationships
   $results = $user->with(array('posts'=>array('arg1')))->find_many();
   // will call the relationship defined in the user model with the argument "arg1"

```

Added a new way to handle filters
----------------------------------
With the __call inclusion on the ORMWrapper now you can create static functions on the model,prepended with "filter_":

```php
public static function filter_aname($orm, $argument1, $argument2...){
    return $orm->where('property', 'value')->limit('X')......;
}
```
and call it on a static call
```php
ModelName::aname($argument1, $argument2)->....
```


Lazy loading
-------------
Triying to access to a not fetched relationship will call and return it

```php
  $results = $user->find_many();
  foreach($results as $result){
      echo $result->avatar->img;
  }
```

Notice that if there is no result for `avatar` on the above example it will throw a `Notice: Trying to get property of non-object...`
Note:  Maybe worth the effort to create a NULL object for this use case and others.



Multiple additions names for Granada
------------------------------------
select_raw = select_expr

group_by_raw

order_by_raw

raw_join

insert : To create and save multiple elements from an array

pluck : returns a single column from the result.

find_pairs : Return array of key=>value as result

save : accepts now a boolean to use "ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE" (just for Mysql)

delete_many : you could use it to delete from a join clause, defining the table that you want to delete



Added overload to set and get properties
-----------------------------------------

SET
----
```php
    // In the Model
    protected function set_title($value)
    {
        $this->alias = Str::slug($value);
        $this->title = $value;
    }
```
```php
    // outside of the model
    $model->set('title', 'A title');

    // works with multiple set too
    $properties = array(
      'title'   => 'A title',
      'content' => 'Some content'
    );
    $model->set($properties);

    // try it with a direct assignement
    $model->title = 'A title';
```


GET
----
Overload of get works only on non defined or empty attributes
TODO:: check it to work on defined attributtes too
```php
    // In the Model
    protected function get_path(){
        return 'whatever';
    }

    ...

    // outside of the model
    echo $model->path; // returns 'whatever'
```

Define resultSet class on Model
-----------------------------------------

Now is possible to define the resultSet class returned for a model instances result. (if `return_result_sets` config variable is set to true)
Notice that the resultSet class defined must `extends IdiormResultSet` and must be loaded

```php
    // In the Model
    public static $resultSetClass = 'TreeResultSet';
```
```php
    // outside of the model
    var_dump($model->find_many());

    // echoes
    object(TreeResultSet)[10]
        protected '_results' => array(...)
    ....
```

ResultSets are defined by the model in the result, as you can see above.
On eager load, the results are consistent.
For example, if we have a `Content` model, with `$resultSetClass = 'TreeResultSet'` and a `has_many` relationship defined as `media`:

```php

  Content::with('media')->find_many();

```
will return a TreeResultSet with instances of Content each with a `property $media` containing a `IdiormResultSet` (the default resultSet if none if defined on the Model)


Basic Documentation comes from Paris:
-------------------------------------
Paris
=====

---
### Feature complete

Paris is now considered to be feature complete as of version 1.4.0. Whilst it will continue to be maintained with bug fixes there will be no further new features added.

---

A lightweight Active Record implementation for PHP5.

Built on top of [Idiorm](http://github.com/j4mie/idiorm/).

Tested on PHP 5.2.0+ - may work on earlier versions with PDO and the correct database drivers.

Released under a [BSD license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses).

Features
--------

* Extremely simple configuration.
* Exposes the full power of [Idiorm](http://github.com/j4mie/idiorm/)'s fluent query API.
* Supports associations.
* Simple mechanism to encapsulate common queries in filter methods.
* Built on top of [PDO](http://php.net/pdo).
* Uses [prepared statements](http://uk.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php) throughout to protect against [SQL injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) attacks.
* Database agnostic. Currently supports SQLite, MySQL, Firebird and PostgreSQL. May support others, please give it a try!
* Supports collections of models with method chaining to filter or apply actions to multiple results at once.
* Multiple connections are supported

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is hosted on Read the Docs: [paris.rtfd.org](http://paris.rtfd.org)

### Building the Docs ###

You will need to install [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) and then in the docs folder run:

    make html

The documentation will now be in docs/_build/html/index.html

Let's See Some Code
-------------------
```php
class User extends Model {
    public function tweets() {
        return $this->has_many('Tweet');
    }
}

class Tweet extends Model {}

$user = Model::factory('User')
    ->where_equal('username', 'j4mie')
    ->find_one();
$user->first_name = 'Jamie';
$user->save();

$tweets = $user->tweets()->find_many();
foreach ($tweets as $tweet) {
    echo $tweet->text;
}
```
